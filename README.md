My application is about purchasing movie tickets.
Initially the application asks the user whether the person wants to watch the movie or not. If the user wants to watch the movie then
it prompts the user to enter name and how many persons are going to watch the movie.
The price of movie ticket depends upon the number of units(persons/tickets).The price varies to number of units.
If only one person is going to watch the movie the price is only 15.0m it multiples number of units(tickets) and price of the ticket.
If two persons are going to watch the movie, the price is 12.0m so it calculates and gives the result as 24.0.
This process limits only upto 4 tickets.
If the number of tickets exceeds to 4 the application exits and says  "You can purchase only 4 tickets at a time".
