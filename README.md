My application is about purchasing movie tickets.
It is based on how many persons are going watch the movie.
The price of ticket depends on the number of persons.
If only one person is going to watch the movie the price is only 15.0m it calculates number of units(persons) * price of the ticket.
If two persons are going to watch the movie the price is 12.0m so it calculates and gives the output.
This process limits only upto 4 tickets.
If the number of persons exceeds to 4 the application exits and says  "You can purchase only 4 tickets at a time".
